# Custom Xcode Templates

This contents repo should reside at `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/
` for your custom templates to show in Xcode's `File>New` dialog.

The easiest way to create a new template is by copying one of Xcode's built in templates and modifying it. They can be found in the following locations.

MacOS Project templates
`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates
`

iOS Project templates
`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS
`

File templates
`/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates
`

If you need some help getting started, here are a few useful guides I've found.
